# Mission-to-Mars
### At the time of submission, the url for the challenge assignment was down since 7 pm PST and hence could not do any testing on the code changes to see if it works. Other students ran into the same issue based on messages in Slack and hopefully there will be an extension to test out the code and resubmit once the site is back up
